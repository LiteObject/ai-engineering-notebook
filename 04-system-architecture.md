# Section 4: System Architecture Planning

## üèóÔ∏è Building Your AI System Architecture

A good architecture makes your AI system scalable, maintainable, and reliable. Think of it as the blueprint for your AI house - get this right, and everything else becomes easier.

### Core Components of AI Systems

Every AI system needs these fundamental components:

#### 1. Data Layer
**Purpose**: Store and manage all data  
**Components**:
- Raw data storage (data lake/warehouse)
- Processed data storage (feature store)
- Model artifacts storage
- Metadata and lineage tracking

#### 2. Processing Layer
**Purpose**: Transform data and train models  
**Components**:
- Data pipelines (ETL/ELT)
- Feature engineering
- Model training infrastructure
- Experimentation tracking

#### 3. Model Layer
**Purpose**: Deploy and serve predictions  
**Components**:
- Model registry
- Model serving infrastructure
- API gateway
- Load balancing

#### 4. Application Layer
**Purpose**: User-facing applications  
**Components**:
- User interfaces
- API endpoints
- Integration services
- Business logic

#### 5. Monitoring Layer
**Purpose**: Track system health and performance  
**Components**:
- Performance monitoring
- Data drift detection
- Model performance tracking
- Alerting systems

### Architecture Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Batch Processing
**Best For**: Periodic predictions, large data volumes, non-real-time requirements

```
Data Sources ‚Üí Data Pipeline ‚Üí Model Training ‚Üí Batch Predictions ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Application
```

**Example**: Monthly customer churn prediction
- Collect customer data monthly
- Train model on historical data
- Generate predictions for all customers
- Store results in database
- Business teams access via dashboard

**Pros**: Simple, cost-effective, handles large volumes
**Cons**: Not real-time, predictions can become stale

#### Pattern 2: Real-time Streaming
**Best For**: Immediate predictions, real-time decision making

```
Data Stream ‚Üí Feature Engineering ‚Üí Model Serving ‚Üí Real-time Predictions ‚Üí Application
```

**Example**: Fraud detection
- Transaction data streams in real-time
- Extract features immediately
- Make instant fraud/not-fraud prediction
- Block suspicious transactions automatically

**Pros**: Immediate results, fresh predictions
**Cons**: More complex, higher costs, scaling challenges

#### Pattern 3: Hybrid (Lambda Architecture)
**Best For**: Both real-time and batch processing needs

```
Batch Layer:    Data ‚Üí Batch Processing ‚Üí Batch Views
                                              ‚Üì
Real-time Layer: Stream ‚Üí Real-time Processing ‚Üí Real-time Views ‚Üí Merged Views
```

**Example**: Recommendation system
- Batch: Daily model training on all historical data
- Real-time: Instant personalization based on current session
- Combine both for final recommendations

### Deployment Strategies

#### 1. Cloud-Native Architecture

**Serverless Approach**:
```
API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda Functions ‚Üí Model Inference ‚Üí Database
```

**Pros**: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use, minimal ops
**Cons**: Cold starts, vendor lock-in, timeouts
**Best For**: Sporadic traffic, simple models

**Container Approach**:
```
Load Balancer ‚Üí Kubernetes Pods ‚Üí Model Containers ‚Üí Storage
```

**Pros**: Flexible, portable, easy scaling
**Cons**: More complex, requires orchestration knowledge
**Best For**: High traffic, complex models, multi-model serving

#### 2. Edge Deployment

**Mobile/IoT Devices**:
```
Local Data ‚Üí On-Device Model ‚Üí Local Predictions
```

**Pros**: Low latency, privacy-preserving, works offline
**Cons**: Limited compute, model size constraints
**Best For**: Mobile apps, IoT sensors, privacy-sensitive applications

### Sample Architecture: Email Classification System

```
Email Servers (IMAP/SMTP)
          ‚Üì
    Data Pipeline (Apache Airflow)
          ‚Üì
    Feature Store (Redis/DynamoDB)
          ‚Üì
    Model Training (MLflow + Kubernetes)
          ‚Üì
    Model Registry (MLflow)
          ‚Üì
    Model Serving (FastAPI + Docker)
          ‚Üì
    API Gateway (Kong/AWS API Gateway)
          ‚Üì
    Email Client Integration
          ‚Üì
    Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
```

#### Detailed Component Breakdown:

**Data Pipeline**:
- **Airflow DAGs**: Extract emails, clean text, extract features
- **Schedule**: Hourly for new emails, daily for model retraining
- **Storage**: Raw emails ‚Üí S3, processed features ‚Üí PostgreSQL

**Model Training**:
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes cluster with GPU nodes
- **Experimentation**: MLflow for tracking experiments
- **Automation**: Trigger retraining when performance drops

**Model Serving**:
- **API**: FastAPI application with REST endpoints
- **Containerization**: Docker containers for easy deployment
- **Scaling**: Kubernetes HPA based on CPU/memory usage

**Integration**:
- **Email Clients**: Plugin/extension that calls API
- **Feedback Loop**: User corrections fed back to training data
- **Monitoring**: Track API latency, accuracy, user satisfaction

### Technology Stack Recommendations

#### For Small Projects (< 10,000 predictions/day)
**Data Storage**: PostgreSQL or SQLite  
**Processing**: Python scripts with pandas  
**Model Serving**: Flask/FastAPI on single server  
**Monitoring**: Simple logging + alerts  
**Deployment**: Single cloud instance (EC2, Compute Engine)

#### For Medium Projects (10K - 1M predictions/day)
**Data Storage**: PostgreSQL + Redis for caching  
**Processing**: Apache Airflow for orchestration  
**Model Serving**: Docker containers with load balancer  
**Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana  
**Deployment**: Kubernetes or managed container service

#### For Large Projects (> 1M predictions/day)
**Data Storage**: Data warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery) + feature store  
**Processing**: Apache Spark + Kubernetes  
**Model Serving**: Kubernetes with auto-scaling  
**Monitoring**: Full observability stack (Datadog, New Relic)  
**Deployment**: Multi-region cloud deployment

### Design Principles

#### 1. Scalability
- **Horizontal scaling**: Add more machines rather than bigger machines
- **Stateless services**: Each request independent of others
- **Caching**: Store frequently accessed data in memory
- **Load balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple instances

#### 2. Reliability
- **Redundancy**: No single points of failure
- **Health checks**: Automatic detection of failed components
- **Circuit breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues working even if some components fail

#### 3. Maintainability
- **Modular design**: Separate components with clear interfaces
- **Version control**: Track changes to code, models, and data
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation for all components
- **Testing**: Automated tests for all components

#### 4. Security
- **Authentication**: Verify user identity
- **Authorization**: Control access to resources
- **Encryption**: Protect data in transit and at rest
- **Audit logging**: Track all system access and changes

### Common Architecture Pitfalls

‚ùå **Monolithic Design**: Everything in one big application
‚úÖ **Fix**: Break into microservices with clear boundaries

‚ùå **No Model Versioning**: Can't roll back to previous model
‚úÖ **Fix**: Use model registry with version control

‚ùå **Synchronous Everything**: One slow component blocks everything
‚úÖ **Fix**: Use asynchronous processing where possible

‚ùå **No Monitoring**: Can't tell when system is failing
‚úÖ **Fix**: Implement comprehensive monitoring from day one

‚ùå **Tight Coupling**: Components too dependent on each other
‚úÖ **Fix**: Use APIs and message queues for loose coupling

### Architecture Decision Framework

#### Step 1: Requirements Analysis
- **Performance**: How fast must predictions be?
- **Scale**: How many predictions per second/day?
- **Availability**: What uptime is required?
- **Latency**: Real-time, near real-time, or batch?

#### Step 2: Constraint Assessment
- **Budget**: What can you afford to spend?
- **Team skills**: What technologies does your team know?
- **Compliance**: What regulatory requirements exist?
- **Timeline**: How quickly must you deliver?

#### Step 3: Technology Selection
- **Start simple**: Choose technologies your team understands
- **Plan for growth**: Ensure architecture can scale
- **Avoid over-engineering**: Don't build what you don't need yet
- **Consider vendor lock-in**: Balance convenience vs. flexibility

#### Step 4: Validation
- **Proof of concept**: Build small version to test assumptions
- **Load testing**: Verify performance under expected load
- **Failure testing**: Test what happens when components fail
- **Cost modeling**: Estimate ongoing operational costs
