# Section 2: Data Strategy & Collection

## ðŸ“Š Your AI is Only as Good as Your Data

Data is the fuel of AI systems. Poor data quality leads to poor AI performance, no matter how sophisticated your algorithms are. This section helps you plan a robust data strategy.

### Data Planning Checklist

Before collecting a single data point, answer these questions:

- **What data do we need?** (features, labels, volume)
- **Where can we get it?** (internal systems, APIs, public datasets)
- **What's the data quality like?** (completeness, accuracy, bias)
- **How will we collect and store it?** (pipelines, databases, formats)
- **What are the privacy/legal requirements?**

### Types of Data You'll Need

#### Input Features
The information your AI will use to make predictions:
- **Structured data**: Numbers, categories, dates
- **Unstructured data**: Text, images, audio, video
- **Time series**: Data that changes over time
- **Metadata**: Information about the data itself

#### Output Labels
What you want your AI to predict:
- **Classification**: Categories (spam/not spam, cat/dog)
- **Regression**: Numbers (price, temperature, score)
- **Ranking**: Order of preference
- **Generation**: Creating new content

### Data Sources

#### Internal Sources
- **Databases**: Customer records, transaction logs
- **Applications**: User interactions, system logs
- **Sensors**: IoT devices, monitoring systems
- **Documents**: Reports, emails, contracts

#### External Sources
- **APIs**: Social media, weather, financial data
- **Public datasets**: Government data, research datasets
- **Third-party providers**: Data vendors, aggregators
- **Web scraping**: Publicly available web data (check legal requirements!)

#### Synthetic Data
- **Generated data**: Create artificial training examples
- **Augmented data**: Modify existing data (rotate images, paraphrase text)
- **Simulated data**: Model-based data generation

### Data Quality Requirements

#### The 6 Dimensions of Data Quality

1. **Completeness**: How much data is missing?
   - Target: <5% missing values for critical fields
   - Plan for handling missing data

2. **Accuracy**: How correct is the data?
   - Validate against known ground truth
   - Check for logical inconsistencies

3. **Consistency**: Is data formatted the same way?
   - Standardize units, formats, naming conventions
   - Resolve conflicts between data sources

4. **Timeliness**: How fresh is the data?
   - Define acceptable data age
   - Plan for regular data updates

5. **Validity**: Does data follow business rules?
   - Check data types and ranges
   - Validate against business constraints

6. **Uniqueness**: Are there duplicate records?
   - Identify and handle duplicates
   - Define what constitutes a unique record

### Sample Data Strategy: Email Classification

```
Required Data:
â€¢ Input Features:
  - Email subject line (text)
  - Email body content (text)
  - Sender domain (categorical)
  - Time sent (datetime)
  - Recipient department (categorical)

â€¢ Output Labels:
  - Email category: [Spam, Important, Newsletter, Personal, Work]

Volume Needed:
â€¢ Minimum: 100,000 labeled emails
â€¢ Target: 500,000 emails for best performance
â€¢ Split: 70% training, 15% validation, 15% testing

Data Sources:
â€¢ Internal: Company email servers (with permission)
â€¢ External: Public spam datasets (SpamAssassin, Enron)
â€¢ Synthetic: Generate test emails for edge cases

Quality Requirements:
â€¢ Completeness: All emails must have subject and body
â€¢ Accuracy: Manual verification of 10% random sample
â€¢ Freshness: Include emails from last 2 years
â€¢ Bias Check: Balanced across departments and email types
```

### Data Collection Pipeline

#### Step 1: Data Discovery
- Inventory available data sources
- Assess data quality and volume
- Identify data gaps

#### Step 2: Data Access
- Negotiate access permissions
- Set up secure connections
- Handle authentication and authorization

#### Step 3: Data Extraction
- Build automated extraction pipelines
- Handle different data formats
- Plan for incremental updates

#### Step 4: Data Validation
- Check data quality metrics
- Identify and flag anomalies
- Log data lineage and transformations

#### Step 5: Data Storage
- Choose appropriate storage format
- Implement backup and versioning
- Ensure security and compliance

### Privacy and Legal Considerations

#### Key Regulations
- **GDPR** (EU): Consent, right to deletion, data minimization
- **CCPA** (California): Transparency, opt-out rights
- **HIPAA** (Healthcare): Protected health information
- **FERPA** (Education): Student record privacy

#### Best Practices
1. **Data minimization**: Collect only what you need
2. **Anonymization**: Remove personally identifiable information
3. **Consent management**: Clear opt-in/opt-out mechanisms
4. **Audit trails**: Track data usage and access
5. **Secure storage**: Encryption, access controls

### Common Data Challenges

#### Challenge 1: Insufficient Data
**Symptoms**: Poor model performance, overfitting
**Solutions**: 
- Data augmentation techniques
- Transfer learning from pre-trained models
- Synthetic data generation
- Collect more data over time

#### Challenge 2: Biased Data
**Symptoms**: Unfair predictions for certain groups
**Solutions**:
- Audit training data for representation
- Oversample underrepresented groups
- Use bias detection tools
- Diverse data collection strategies

#### Challenge 3: Data Drift
**Symptoms**: Model performance degrades over time
**Solutions**:
- Monitor data distribution changes
- Implement automatic retraining
- Set up data quality alerts
- Regular data audits

#### Challenge 4: Noisy Labels
**Symptoms**: Inconsistent or incorrect labels
**Solutions**:
- Multiple annotator agreement
- Label quality scoring
- Active learning for difficult cases
- Expert review processes

### Tools and Technologies

#### Data Storage
- **Relational databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **NoSQL databases**: MongoDB, Cassandra
- **Data warehouses**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift
- **Data lakes**: AWS S3, Azure Data Lake

#### Data Processing
- **ETL tools**: Apache Airflow, Talend, Informatica
- **Big data**: Apache Spark, Hadoop
- **Streaming**: Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis
- **Python libraries**: Pandas, Dask, Polars

#### Data Quality
- **Profiling**: Great Expectations, Apache Griffin
- **Monitoring**: Monte Carlo, Bigeye
- **Validation**: Cerberus, Schema
- **Lineage**: Apache Atlas, DataHub

### Action Items

1. **Inventory your data sources** - What data do you already have access to?
2. **Define quality requirements** - What are your minimum standards?
3. **Identify data gaps** - What additional data do you need?
4. **Plan collection strategy** - How will you gather missing data?
5. **Consider privacy implications** - What legal requirements apply?
6. **Design storage architecture** - How will you store and access data?
7. **Set up monitoring** - How will you track data quality over time?
